## Overview 
This processor ia a part of the IIT Indore Techsoc. The processor built in this project is based on a customly built architecture and ISA to tackle various problems faced in the processor data handling. The main idea of the processor is to maintain a single flow data lines and a multi- accumulator system along a pipelined instruction structure inorder to minimize any pluasible instruction hazard. This Architecture also involves a clock altered circuit which helps use the negative half of the clock cycle to move data in various non-conflicting areas.


## Introduction
This processor ia a part of the IIT Indore Techsoc, which is a techincal hackathon which is annually conducted at IIT Indore with problem statements in various domains. The current processor was a problem statement under the electronics domain which involved a pipelined 8-Bit microprocessor.
